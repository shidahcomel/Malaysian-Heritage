                <h2>Congkak</h2>
                <p>Congkak is a traditional Malaysian board game that involves strategy and counting. It is played on a wooden board with two rows of small holes and two larger end holes called "stores." Each player starts with an equal number of seeds in their holes and takes turns distributing them counterclockwise. The goal is to collect as many seeds as possible in one’s store. Popular among Malaysians, especially in villages, congkak helps develop mathematical skills and strategic thinking while preserving cultural heritage.</p>

                <h2>Batu Seremban</h2>
                <p>Batu Seremban is a traditional Malaysian game played with five or more small beanbags filled with rice, sand, or seeds. Players take turns tossing and catching the bags in a series of increasingly difficult moves, such as picking up multiple bags in one go. The game tests hand-eye coordination, dexterity, and concentration. It is commonly played by children, especially girls, and is a popular pastime in Malaysian households and schools. Traditionally, small stones were used instead of beanbags, giving the game its name.</p>

                <p>Baling Selipar is a traditional Malaysian game played in teams, where players use a slipper to knock down a stacked pile of slippers or objects. One team throws the slipper to topple the stack, while the opposing team tries to rebuild it before all their players are tagged out. The game requires accuracy, teamwork, and speed. Often played in open spaces like school fields or village yards, Baling Selipar is a fun and energetic childhood pastime that fosters cooperation and agility.</p>

                <p>Gasing is a traditional Malaysian game where players spin a top using a wound string and a quick pull. Made from wood or metal, the top can spin for several minutes depending on the player’s skill. The game is especially popular in states like Kelantan and Melaka, with some variations focusing on endurance while others involve knocking opponents’ tops out of a designated area. Traditionally played after the harvest season, gasing is a cultural heritage that requires strength, precision, and technique.</p>

                <h2>Teng Teng</h2>
                <p>Teng Teng is a traditional Malaysian hopscotch game played by drawing numbered boxes on the ground. Players take turns tossing a small object, such as a stone, into a specific box and then hop through the course on one foot, skipping the box with the object. The goal is to complete the course without losing balance or stepping on the lines. Teng Teng helps develop balance, coordination, and concentration, making it a popular childhood game, especially in schools and villages.</p>
